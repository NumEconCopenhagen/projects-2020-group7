Our portfolio come in three part:

A. Projects

i. Inaugural project: In this project we maximized the utility of consumer utilities subject to his budget constraint and find the optimal consumption and labor supply with defined prametrs. Also, we compute the total tax in optimal situation and how it reacts to elasticity. In the last part we compute standard labor incom and top bracket labor incom and total tax. We learn how to use functions,loops, plotting and several other features in python.

ii. Model project: It was a good exercise for solving an economics problem numerically and symbolically. we use Ramsy model. At first defined houshold and firms function then find the steady state, capital , consumption and production per effective labor. plotting the phase diagram and diffrent paths helps to visulized in a better way.

iii. Data project: In data project we works with pandas mainly how to import data and clean it. Hence, we start with Denmark Trade Data. we analyze them in order to find what is the balance trade of Denmark, main export and import partners for goods and service during 2005-2019 . we also plot our finding.
