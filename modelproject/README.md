# Model analysis project

In this project we start with a classical intertemporal optimization problem in two periods. Our representative household exhibits a CRRA utility function and we want to detect the optimal bundle given underlying parameters. Then we move on in section.4 defining the firm optimizing behaviour. In section.5, we add complexity to the model making our representative consumer and firm interact under the features of the classical Ramsey model. Here, we rely on the book Robert J.Barro and Xavier Sala-i-Martin, Economic Growth for the main results. We come up with the phase diagram for different consumption and capital paths trying to detect the unique saddle path and steady state for the particular variables we give to the problem. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [Model Project.ipynb](Model Project.ipynb).
