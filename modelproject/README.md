# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **PROJECT TITLE** and is about EXPLAIN.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

In this project we explained **Ramsy** model , but at first we optimized the two period lived household utility subject to its constraint. Then we defined the Euler equation to find the optimal consumption of HH for these two periods, and plot the optimal household behavior underlying parameters changing.
Then we go for the firmâ€™s optimal behavior by defining the production function and profit function. And define the derivation respect to capital and labor per effective worker.
At the end we make our result in firm and  consumer under the Ramsy model. And find the steady state and plot the phase diagram and saddle path.
